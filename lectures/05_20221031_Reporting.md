# Lecture #5: Reporting

_October 31 2022_

Reporting typically builds on top of the data you have in your Data Warehouse.

Three ways I would recommend on how to deal with it, based on your organization size and budget:

1. Personal / small startup level: Simple & stupid (& cheap): reporting inside a Jupyter notebook
   * Nice and real-world inspired articles:
     * https://blog.dominodatalab.com/interactive-dashboards-in-jupyter/
     * https://blog.dominodatalab.com/lesser-known-ways-of-using-notebooks/
   * Bonus: handy JavaScript-based pivot table analysis tool – [PivotTableJS](http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/)
2. Small and Medium Enterprise level: e.g. [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/), [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) or [Good Data](https://www.gooddata.com/) via [Keboola](https://www.keboola.com/)
3. Enterprise level: e.g. [SQL Server Reporting Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/reporting-services/create-deploy-and-manage-mobile-and-paginated-reports) (SSRS)
   * See **Chapter 10 - Building BI Applications in Reporting Services - A High-Level Architecture for Reporting in the MS DWH Toolkit** — definitely read this one, to understand in full detail what reporting typically means and you will understand the motivation for proper separation of concerns (the data, business logic, presentation layer, the execution back-end) and the ideal tooling
